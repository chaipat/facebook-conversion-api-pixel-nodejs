# Importance of `event_source_url`
## Contextual Information: 
It provides Facebook with additional context about the event, such as the content or product page that the user was interacting with.

## Attribution: 
Helps in attributing the event to the correct ad or marketing campaign by linking the user's actions to specific pages on your website.

## Verification: 
Assists in verifying the authenticity and accuracy of the events being tracked, ensuring that the data reflects real user interactions on your website.
